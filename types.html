        <p>In coding you can learn code, but often you get stuck on the code itself. Today I will
            be talking about the driffent types of code I know. Ready? Lets get started.
            I will be covering:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Html</li>
            <li>Css</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Scratch</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <p>Okay. Heads up. I want to say that I am including scratch, because it has some similarits to javascript, and you can convert projects to html. Now first things first. The first type of code we are going to be
            looking at is...
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>1 : Html</h1>
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/HTML5.jpeg" width="400" height="200">
        <p>If I had to choose 1 coding language, it would be html. Why? Here's my list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1 : I can use just html to make a website</li>
            <li>2 : You actually can add a bit of interactivicty with html, eg: onclick</li>
            <li>3 : Easy to use, you just got to memorize some tags</li>
            <li>4 : It's easier to use then inserting data with javascript, and dosen't take up more time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Also Its argubaly the coding language I use the most. For the blog, really what youre reading right now, I 
            spend all this time typing header and paragraphs and breaks mostly Unlike javascript where I ussaly do a lot more stuff
            like append child methods and all that. And the good thing about html means that
            you don't waste time. At least for me. Now lets move on to the pros and cons
        </p>
        <h2>Pros and cons</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can just use html to make a website/webpage</li>
            <li>Dosen't waste a lot of time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Common coding language</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is not that interactive</li>
            <li>No styling</li>
            <li>Not a programming language.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>2 : Css </h1>
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/css.jpeg" width="400" height="200">
        <p>
            The second type of coding I am going to be talking about is css.
            Css is a great coding language in it's own right. Simply all you have to do is link css to a html file 
            and you can start applying some styling into your html. Also it is really easy to learn. You can also do 
            a lot with it. Like I can litrelly using css I made the navbar buttons have an animation. Cool right? Now lets move onto pros and cons.
        </p>
        <button onclick="window.location.href='gamespage.html'">
            <h2>Bored out of your mind?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>I suggest you go to the games section of my website! 
                (click the button!)
            </p>
        </button>
        <h2>Pros and cons</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Adds very efective styling</li>
            <li>Can make teeny tiny animations</li>
            <li>Easy to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can confuse you, as you need to have a semicolon on the end.</li>
            <li>Cant' do everything you want it to do</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>3 : Javascript</h1>
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/javascript.jpeg" height="200" width="200">
        <p>
            Javascript. The first coding language I learnt, and the best programming language to me. I said Programming language
            by the way. It is a good language to learn, and also It can do EVERYTHING html can do. Sort of. ish.
            Its a really good programing language to learn as well. In its pros and cons list I will give it one 
            Disidvantege. For a good reason.
        </p>
        <h2>Pros and cons</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adds a lot of interactivity</li>
            <li>Can litrelly insert stuff eg images, and not have to use html. But will 
                eventually have to use html.
            </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Can sometimes take up time</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>4 : Scratch</h1>
        <img src="images/scratch.jpeg" width="300" height="200">
        <br><br>
        <p>Cant really put pros and cons in here because 
            It is actually very simmilar to Javascript. They if if else statements, loops and stuff
            like that.I would also like to pint out that it was originnaly made of for kids. But adults started using it 
            and that happend. I use it for fun and if you want view <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CoderChip404/" target="_blank">my profile here </a>.
