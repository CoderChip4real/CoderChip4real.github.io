                    Long ago I wanted to be a coder. So I took up 
                    Grasshopper. I did all of the courses, and the one I liked most was Web Development. And I wanted
                    to expand my skills. So I took coding Nz, and to my dissapointment, while I learnt a lot of the p5.js Javascript
                    framework, I just did not learn a whole lot of web dev. So I started looking at Utube tuts.And About 6months of programming,
                    I released the first version of the website. For those of you who want to see the main page which I preserved on the wayback machine, the link is here : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231031080232/https://coderchip.tech/">Click Here!</a>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>And as you  can see it is bassicly a bunch of buttons. But that was about to change.</p>
                <p>For the next couple of weeks I kept adding new posts. And then I went completly silent. Like litreally. And then on December I updated the Home page saying, Update delyaed. And yes that update was the major update that changed the webstie.</p>
                <p>And now look where I am. It was not a easy Journey, but I definitly will say It does take a lot of time to become a pro. I hope I can help you, as well as make sure you become a pro!! </p>
