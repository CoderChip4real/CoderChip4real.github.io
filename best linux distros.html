        <h1>Best linux distros(my opinion) part 1</h1>
        <h4>Published: 13th Augest 2023</h4>

        <p>Unlike windows Linux comes in driffent distrobutions, and since linux code is open sourced anyone can use the code and make thier own.</p>
        <p>
            HOwever a lot of people use linux as well. ANd if you want to start usingLinux but dont know which distrobution to use keep reading.
            Now I just want to point out here that the reason I dont use linux is because I need a better computor. Im gonna be honest I dont have a pc. 
            I use  this :

        <p>Anyways lets a go!</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>What Distro would I want?</h2>
        <p>Garuda Linux. It is a really cool ditro, And arch based + It look cool and comes with a gaming edition. And its very powerful.</p>
        <h1>Best for begginers</h1>
        <h2>Ubuntu</h2>
        <img src="images/ubuntu.png">
        <h6>ubuntu lunar lobster credit: wikipedia</h6>
        <p>
            This distrobution is well known among the people of linux. It can be used by beggining and
            advanced users. It is debian based, and gnome look based. Overall it has a nice feel and has long term support
            and not to mention you can install a multitude of apps on it becasue it is popular. It also comes in a lot of
            flavours, so if you dont like the normal look you can get a flavour. Releases come out every 6 months, and you can
            download  ubuntu server and ubuntu Iot and ubuntu cloud. So really recomend this I wish I could install it, but I just
            have too much stuff on my computor. However you may want to look out for the interface, because I bet 75% of you are using windows,
            so try use a driffent flavour if migrating from windows or use the next on the list .. 
        </p>

        <h2>Linux mint</h2>
        <img src="images/linuxmint.png">
        <h6>Linux Mint 21 "Vanessa" (Cinnamon) source Wikipedia</h6>
        <p>
            THis is another well known distribution, that is perfect among the migrating windows users. It has that 
            interface so much like windows, and has a lot of similarities. Scince it is popullar like ubuntu a lot of apps
            support it and will be able to use it to download popular apps, eg brave, vs code, and much more. I think This
            deservs a i dunno a 9.9/10. Anyways moving on .. 
        </p>
        <h2>Nitrux OS</h2>
        <img src="images/nitrux os.png">
        <h6>Img src nxos.org</h6>
        <p>
            This is simmilar to linux mint, and simmilar to ubuntu.
            It has a bunch of stuff like its own file explorer, and media player, 
            and also really nice look. I think I would probably give it a try.However worth noting that you shouldnt be using
            it on a older computor. THats the same for ubuntu as well so make sure to always be aware of the requiments for each
            distrobutions, because you might get a blue screen of death.
