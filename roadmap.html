        <h1>Roadmap for coding</h1>
        <h4>Published:no idea</h4>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            In coding especially as a begginer we never know where to start. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do I need to learn?</li>
            <li>Where do I learn ?</li>
            <li>How do I need to learn?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While there is a lot of stuff to learn it is also essential that you know which path to learn 
            so you dont get mixed up on which stuff you are learning. Today I will be covering:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding languages</li>
            <li>Code editors an what they are</li>
            <li>Where to learn how to code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ready? lets get started.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Coding languages</h1>
        <p>
            With coding, if you have never done it before you might have thought 'Oh well coding is hard but its just one thing. 
            Not a whole lot of other things.'Sorry to say but you are either 1/4 right or 1/2 right.
            In coding there is more than one type of code. The first thing everyone needs to learn about code is to know your coding languages.
            The most common coding languages are:
            Html,
            css,
            And javascript.
            Alright I know there are more coding languages but these are the ones I mostly use and these 3 I use all the time.
            Html and css are really the stuff that is used to make websites. Like this one right now. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Html</h2>
        <img src="images/html5.jpg" width="200" height="200">
        <p>
            The first language 
            you should probably learn is Html. Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language Its like the base of the website. It lets you make the text, lists and paragraphs and lets you make titles.
            You can also do this with javascript as well, but I like to use javascript to make games. Thats my suggestion though.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Css</h2>
        <img src="images/css.jpg" width="400" height="200">
        <p>
            The second language to learn is Css Which stands for Cassading Style Sheets. It adds the color font, makes the webpage pretty, and can customize pretty much every single bit of html. Buttons,text,Paragraphs. You name it.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <img src="images/javascript.jpg" width="200" height="200">
        <p>
            What I describe Javascript is like adding interactivicty. I have used it in the past to help design webpages but I dont really use it with webpages unless I am making  shapes and games. Still its essential. A good place to learn it is at <a href="https://grasshopper.app/" target="_blank">Grashopper</a>
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Code editors</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What is a code editor?</h2>
        <p>
            A code editor is what we use to make code. Its also used to make files for html, css, and javascript.
            And depending on what sort of code editor you have, you might get special extensions and stuff like that.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What code editor should I use?</h2>
        <p>
            There are multiple code editors out there but here are some good free ones
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime text</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad ++</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Which one do I use you may be asking? I use Visual studio code because you can customize your theme, its open sourced, easy to use and it can give definitions of html tags! 
            I also use it because it can come up with suggestions and if you click on a suggestion it will automaticly type it for you!(Unless you are writing html tags you have to add >)
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Where should I learn to code?</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Now that you know a very very small amount of what coding is and how to code you now need to know where should I learn to code?
            Of course there are a few places..
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><a href="https://grasshopper.app/" target="_blank">Grashopper</a></h2>
        <p>
            This was the first place I learn how to code. Their courses are all on Javascript exept for 1 wich focuses on web development but still has web development. Javascript was the first coding language I learned and thanks to grashopper I learned it. Oh and its completly free.(Note: As of June 15th 2023 Grasshopper has shutdown.)
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><a href="https://codingnz.com/" target="_blank">Coding nz</a></h2>
        <p>
            Coding nz. After you have passed mission 1 you from now on get to program games and then 2 applications. The first mission focuses on web development. After the first mission you really learn about javascript.
            It focuses on kids which is the reason they make games. But adults can do it too.
        </p>
        <br><br>
