        <h1>Types of Coding part 2(Let's hope it dosen't become a series)</h1>
        <h4>Published :  23rd July 2023</h4>
        <p>
            Sigh. Why am I doing this.
            Yes, today I am going to cover more types of coding.
            Lets hope this dosen't turn into a 5 part series.
            Today I will be covering 3 types of codes. Lets get into it!
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Python.</h1>
        <img src="images/python.png">
        <p>
            Python. Pretty cool name for a coding language if you ask me.
            It's very simmaler to javascript, so here are some of the key driffences. :
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dosent use braces</li>
            <li>A whole lot easier</li>
            <li>You define varibeles driffently</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Most people learn this first instead of javascript, as it is easier to understand.
            Again it is also a really common coding language, and probally the 2nd or 3rd easiest 
            coding language to understand. Worth noting the only things you ned to start doing python
            are a set of hands, a basic smattering of math, and a computor that works.
            Now on to the next thing ...
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Php</h1>
        <img src="images/php.png">
        <p>Ha ha ha. Php. This is a bit complicated to explain.</p>
        <p>
            The python, now we are onto the elephant.
            Php is quite driffent from most types of coding.
            Heres the most basic rundown I can explain.
            Lets say your sigining up for something on a website.
            Those things you type into are then collected by php, then
            sent into a server, which will then record the information.
            It's pretty useful and personally I think it's really cool. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also according to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/PHP-Hypertext-Preprocessor">Techtarget.com</a>
            78.1 percent of all websites use php. And last but not least,
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Java</h1>
        <img src="images/java.png">
        <p>Nothing like a good cup of coffe.</p>
        <p>
            Sometimes people get confused with java and javascript.
            BUt let me tell you. THEY ARE DRIFFENT THINGS.
            javascript is based on java. IN fact for peoplle
            who think minecraft java edition is built with javascript,
            NO.MINECRAFT JAVA EDITION IS BULIT WITH JAVA NOT JAVASCRIPT.
            Java used to be good back in the day, but then Brendan Eich 
            came along and made Javascript. Java is actually pretty simple.
            But of course nowdays people use javascript. BUt that dosen't mean
            Java is bad. Its actually still used today, and still popular.
            So just dont listen to those who say java is bad.The only reason 
            it get's a lot more critisism nowdays is because it's outdated compared
            to Javascript. SO go learn it.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Closing</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>

            like it, sorry if it looked a bit rushed. Also you guys can now
            support me on Brave browser and tip me Bat! THanks to however tipped
