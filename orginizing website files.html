        <h1>Orginizing your website files.</h1>
        <h4>Published : </h4>
        <p>
            Okay, Let's say you finsihed coding your website. You feel like your ready, but then you feel like
            your not. Today I will show you how to orginize your website files. This will show you how the website 
            mechanics work, and how a main page is chosen as well. I probably won't show you how to host your website
            as I would have to shut down my website for a while. Lets dive in!
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Firstly ... </h1>
        <p>
            Okay. I'm going to show you how to download a template and we will use that as the example(Sorry im just to lazy!)
            A good place to download a template is templated Their link is here<a href="https://templated.co/" target="_blank">https://templated.co/</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/orginizing.png" width="1200" height="700">
        <p>Right. Ima going to download this template here:</p>
        <img src="images/downl.png">
        <p>And now you can see I have the files here</p>
        <img src="images/file.png">
        <p>Now here I am going to unzip the file. TO do this right click on the file and press this : </p>
        <img src="images/extract.png">
        <br><br><br><br>
        <img src="images/extraction.png">
        <p> And now it appers as a folder!</p>
        <img src="images/extracted.png">
        <h1>Real stuff</h1>
        <p>
          Now this is what it looks like. Also dont ask why It says I should open the ds store file in my browser, I once did something weird. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/stuff.png">
        <p>
            Right. Let's start with the main page. The main page is ussaly chosen by a html document called index.html.
            The other pages we ussaly name something else. In your code we ussaly make links to pages like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/links.png">
        <p>
            If you look at the previous image the files were right next to each other so that's why we put it with like that.
            Now you may be wondering how do we link css and javascript? THose are located in assets. Here take a look.
        </p>
        <img src="images/assets (1).png">
        <h2>Css</h2><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down" style="font-size:36px"></i>
        <br>
        <img src="images/assets (2).png">
        <h2>Javascript</h2><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down" style="font-size:36px"></i>
        <br>
        <img src="images/assets (3).png">
        <p>And ussaly the link looks like this instead.</p>
        <img src="images/css org link.png">
        <p>And this is what your javascript link should look lke.</p>
        <img src="images/javalink.png">
        <p>That is pretty simple. This is what the images look like.</p>
        <img src="images/images.png">
        <p>And this is what the link/source looks like:</p>
        <img src="images/imlink.png">
        <p>Lets do a recap. This is what your html pages should look like: But of course this is 
            with the template you dont jave to put everything exactly the same like the template
        </p>
        <img src="images/stuff.png">
        <p>THis is what your assets should look like</p>
        <img src ="images/assets (1).png">
        <p>This is what your css should look like</p>
        <img src="images/assets (2).png">
        <p>And this is what your javascript should look like</p>
        <img src="images/assets (3).png">
        <p>This is what your linked with your css should look like.</p>
        <img src="images/css org link.png">
        <p>THis is what your link with javascript should look like:</p>
        <img src="images/javalink.png">
        <p>And this is what you link with your images should look like.</p>
        <img src="images/imlink.png">
